# sm64_democonv

to use:

create an m64 and st after entering the right stage such that you have to frame advance 18 times before the big lag frame when the stage loads.

hack the uint at 0x80249ac8 (US) or 0x80249a98 (JP) to 0x240e0002 to cause mario to spawn in in idle

then run the script either way

if you're converting a tas to a demo, specify the level number
